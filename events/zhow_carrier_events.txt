# Max Fighters: 36
# Max Bombers: 12
# total 48

# 3 squadrons of 16

# So we cant use variables in ship scopes
# We cant use the fleet for variable storage, because it might have more than one carrier
# There is a few options:
# 1. Allow a limited number of carriers that we can set specific flags on, map those
#    to one random galaxy planet per carrier with a variable ID, and use that planet
#    scope to calculate the strike craft regeneration
# 2. Allow an arbitrary number of carriers. This means we can only use ship flags to
#    control strike craft launches.
# Since we are going for option two, we need to find a way to define launch cooldowns
# using timed ship flags.
# The problem with this is that we want the strike craft squadrons to be quite large
# and launched immediately upon engage, but then regenerate slowly, per-squadron.
# If one squadron consists of 12 crafts, and we want to regenerate 4 crafts per month,
# we need 3x flags per squadron regeneration, and if we have 4 squadrons, that means
# we need 3x4, or 12 flags.
