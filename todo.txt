todo:

add new torpedo sections to all global_ship_designs that need it
lower the range of earlier missile weapons if I can

carrier needs fighter global design if there is no tech
not sure if we actually need to, we seem to get a base design then



- set ship upkeep for fighters/bombers to zero
- can no longer build them
