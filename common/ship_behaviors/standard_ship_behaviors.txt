# PARADOX:
# What was your plan with the use_ship_kill_target = no in XL weapons?
# It is so incredibly destructive to the behavior system.
#
# I think I'm blinded by frustration, but I can NOT see how that property
# is proper for XL weapons.
#
# For missiles, torpedoes? That would be fine. For weapons that can turn? Fine.
# What is going on, can you please explain your though process?!
#
# It's more destructive the longer the chargeup time is on the weapon.
